        I have attempt to use functions while creating this website, However, it
        didn't work.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>I had a lot of trouble with Task 3 and Task 5(refer to the Assignment pdf on Github). I just couldn't make the website to show proper error messages and how to handel faulty input from the user.  </li>
      <li>I would like to add more styling to the whole system to make it more appealing to the user</li>
      <li>I have learnt how to use MYSQL with php. I have also learnt how to make the date in the posting a new status page to show always the current date from this website:<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/php-get-current-date/">click here</a>. Also I have learnt how to use onclick function with the button element from html using this website: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp">click me </a> </li>
      
    </ul>
